# GangGo - Diaspora in GoLang

GangGo is a decentralized social network written in [GoLang](https://golang.org/). It uses the same federation library like [Diaspora](https://diasporafoundation.org/) and therefore can participate in conversations like any other [Pod](https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Choosing_a_pod#Why_do_I_need_to_choose_a_pod.3F)!

## Usage

Fetch the latest updater version from [github.com/ganggo/ganggo/releases](https://github.com/ganggo/ganggo/releases) and execute it. It will come with a small installation wizard and guide you through the first steps.

## Development

Please have a look at our [documentation page](https://ganggo.github.io/development.html)!
